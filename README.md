## Brief Description

This is a very tiny implementation of a RestAPI using Symfony 5. The main goal was to build a back-end API that would be used to manage leave (on holidays) requests from employees of a small business.

## Endpoints

PS: Before diving into the endpoints, we should know that this API is build for two kind of users:   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Human Ressources (HR) : They (1) have access to all leave requests, (2) can accept or refuse a leave request   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Employees : They can (1) ask for a vacation by specifying the period, (2) cancel a specific vacation (3) consult their list of incoming vactions.
